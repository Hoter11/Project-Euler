# NOTE: I'm not happy at all with this solution, however it works.
# It takes an average time of 114s to find the solution. This is a lot! (isn't it?)
# Maybe i'm gonna try for a more efficent solution in the future.

# Largest Prime Factor:
# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
