# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

"""Solution theory
Prime divisors of 2520 --> 5 * 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. With combinations of multiplying those numbers, you can get all numbers between 1 and 10.

So to get the smallest, first all the prime numbers must be multiplied:
2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19
then all others numbers must be able to be reached of multiplications of those numbers.
20 -> 2 * 2 * 5
18 -> 2 * 3 * 3
16 -> 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
...

All we get is the maximum number of every prime number needed.
Solution: 5 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
